<p>After the successful opening of new branches in Q1 and Q2, 2022, the first and fastest growing fitness chain in West Africa, i-Fitness, is forging ahead with its aggressive expansion plan.</p>



<p>The three new branches; Acme, Jakande and Gwarinpa which were launched in the first and second quarter of 2022 respectively, have been of great use to the community dwellers.</p>



<p>i-Fitness is set to open two more branches at Lekki-Maruwa and Ikorodu. While this fitness community might be well known in the Lekki axis of Lagos, Ikorodu is an entirely new community.</p>



<p>The incessant complaint by the Ikorodu dwellers for an opportunity to access a well-furnished and equipped gym did not fall on deaf ears.</p>



<p>“The expansion into Ikorodu is a way of taking advantage of the community&#8217;s long-standing desire for an opportunity to access a well-furnished and equipped gym. With the addition of Lekki-Maruwa, we&#8217;re very excited about what&#8217;s to come.”</p>



<p>With these new and upcoming branches, the i-Fitness community has grown by two more locations, bringing the number of networks to 18.</p>



<p>i-Fitness is the first and fastest-growing fitness chain in West Africa, that aims to promote health and wellness in Nigeria and Africa at large through a variety of fitness classes and a supportive fitness community.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s goal is to create an environment where people can work out in a safe, clean space with qualified trainers who will guide them through each workout.</p>



<p>This consistent push towards expansion is aimed at promoting the culture of fitness in Nigeria and Africa at large.</p>

<p>In compliance with our core values to create a youthful, entertaining and functional environment for our members, i-Fitness is excited to introduce the first ever open house spinning party, The Spinathon party.</p>



<p>The pioneer edition tagged “spin with a hype man” is created to emphasize the importance of fun in fitness. happening monthly in each of our branches starting with ACME Ogba. Each month will be geared towards a particular purpose.</p>



<p>Spinning is a great way to get your heart rate up and burn calories while having fun. It&#8217;s also a great way to build stamina, strength, flexibility and balance as you work out. This is one of the many reasons why we have chosen to reinvent the wheel when it comes to spinning.</p>



<p>The Spinathon party is also a great way for members of the i-Fitness community to bring friends and family together and get them aware about the importance of leading a healthy and active lifestyle!</p>
