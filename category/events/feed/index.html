<p>In compliance with our core values to create a youthful, entertaining and functional environment for our members, i-Fitness is excited to introduce the first ever open house spinning party, The Spinathon party.</p>



<p>The pioneer edition tagged “spin with a hype man” is created to emphasize the importance of fun in fitness. happening monthly in each of our branches starting with ACME Ogba. Each month will be geared towards a particular purpose.</p>



<p>Spinning is a great way to get your heart rate up and burn calories while having fun. It&#8217;s also a great way to build stamina, strength, flexibility and balance as you work out. This is one of the many reasons why we have chosen to reinvent the wheel when it comes to spinning.</p>



<p>The Spinathon party is also a great way for members of the i-Fitness community to bring friends and family together and get them aware about the importance of leading a healthy and active lifestyle!</p>
